The Letter - Shooter Jennings 

C                  G
I found a letter just yesterday
Am                           F
And what it say I can't disclose.
C                  G
I read that letter and every word it say
Am                    F
And my heart it just froze.


CHORUS:
           C                  G
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame
           C                     F
Ain't it shame, such a sad, sad shame
                 C   
My baby's been runnin' around, 
             G
All around this town 
              F  Em Dm C  G*
With another man.

*Note: After the 2nd chorus, the 'G' should be replaced with a B7, to lead into the bridge (the Em-Am section)


C                             G
I packed her stuff up, put it out on the front porch
Am                                F
When she gets home she'll surely see.
C                                          G
You know it was so hard goin' through our life together,
                   Am                       F             
Figurin' out what belongs to you and what belongs to me


CHORUS:
           C                  G
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame
           C                     F
Ain't it shame, such a sad, sad shame
                 C   
My baby's been runnin' around, 
             G
All around this town 
              C   G  F   C
With another man.


Em                      Am
So many times I've forgiven her
Em                   Am
So much time I can never get back
Dm                                     Am
I don't wanna know how long it's been goin' on
Em                                 G
I just wanna leave this town and never look back 


CHORUS:
           C                  G
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame
           C                     F
Ain't it shame, such a sad, sad shame
                 C   
My baby's been runnin' around, 
             G
All around this town 
              F  C  G  C  G
With another man.
             F   C  G  C
Ain't it a shame?
