Oh....  life, it압 bigger, it압 bigger than you, and you are not me, 
                           Em                          Am
The lengths that i will go to, the distance in your eyes,
Em                   Dm                  G
Oh no I았e daid to much, I았e aid it all,
                 Am                       Em                    Am
That압 me in the corner, that압 me in the spotlight losing my religion,
          Em                   Am
Trying to keep a view, and I don앖 know if I can do it,
Em                    Dm                     G
Oh no I았e said too much, I haven앖 said enough,
                            F                                    Am
I thought that I heard you laughing, I thought that I heard you sing,
Dm                          Am            G
I think I rhought I saw you try,
      Am                      Em                     Am
Every whisper, every waking hour I앐 choosing my confessions,
          Em                           Am
Trying to keep an eye on you, like a hurt lost and blind fool,
Em                  Dm              G
Oh no I았e said too much, I said it all,
         Am                   Em                                Am
Consider this, consider this, It압 tough this century, consider this,
   Em                      Am                                 Em
It brought me to my knees, what if all these fantasies coming flailing around
             Dm        G                              F
And now I았e said to much, I thought that I heard you laughing,
                           Am    F                            Am  G  Am
I thought that I heard you sing, I think I thought I saw you try,
Am                     Am
That was just a dream, that was just a dream,
                 Am                       Em
That압 me in the corner, that압 me in the spotlight,
          Am                 Em
Losing my religion trying to keep a view,
      Am                         Em              Dm                   G  
And I don앖 know if I can do it, Oh no I said to much, I haven앖 said enough
                           F                                     Am
