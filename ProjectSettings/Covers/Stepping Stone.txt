Stepping Stone Pop Evil 
Tuning: HALF STEP DOWN!! (very important)

Intro: 
C G Am F

Verse:
C                            G
I got your letter on the table
G
The keys still in the car
Am                               F
Your lipstick stain upon my pillow
F
From the night before
C
I wish i knew my right from wrong

I wish I had affliction
Am
Since I read your letter...
F
Girl, you've been my new addiction

Chorus:

C                          G
I don't need you, to be my stepping stone
Am                  F
I just want you, to come back home
C                         G
And just breathe, and believe it'll be alright
Am                    F
But tonight, for tonight, just let it be

Bridge:

G                         F
All the years that i have spent on you
G                   F
Does it really even matter? (it doesn't really matter)
G                          F
Through the years, will we amount to something?
G                      F
Does it really even matter?
(let F ring)
I don't need you..


Thats basicly the chords, here are the lyrics:


I got your letter on the table
The keys still in the car
Your lipstick stain upon my pillow
From the night before
I wish i knew my right from wrong
I wish I had affliction
Since I read your letter...
Girl, you've been my new addiction

I don't need you, to be my stepping stone
I just want you, to come back home
And just breathe, and believe it'll be alright
But tonight, for tonight, just let it be

I never was one for introductions
'till I first saw your face
And blinded by my intuitions
I had to take a chance now
And looking back, you had your reasons
I couldn't read between the lines
And now your gone...
Nothin' else that I can do

I don't need you, to be my stepping stone
I just want you, to come back home
And just breathe, and believe it'll be alright
But tonight, for tonight, just let it be

All the years that i have spent on you
Does it really even matter? (it doesn't really matter)
Through the years, will we amount to something?
Does it really even matter?
I don't need you..

I don't need you, to be my stepping stone
I just want you, to come back home
And just breathe, and believe it'll be alright
But tonight, for tonight, just let it be
Well I don't need you, to be my stepping stone
I just want you, to come back home
And just breathe, and believe it'll be alright
But tonight, for just one night
