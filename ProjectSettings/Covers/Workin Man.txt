Dm                                           C
i woke up this morning. kissed my wife good-bye
                               Dm 
i pray to god that i make it home safe tonight
                            C
it's a dangerous job but i take that risk 
                                 Dm
i trade my blood and sweat just to feed my kids
                                      C                  
i been working for the man since the tender age
                                Dm        
now a rich politician wants to lower my wage
                                       C                                                                   Dm
pour me a drink so i can understand...these are the struggles of a workin man. 

i work outside in the pourin rain, when it's cold as ice, when i'm full of pain
it dont matter what i feel inside, long as the job that i'm workin gets done on time
the boss man says works getting slow, pack up your tools and head on home
i pour another drink and try to understand, these are the troubles of a workin man

"see i work construction..i build things..do you understand how important
that is to the world? none of ya'll realize the pressure a man like me has on him

i love my wife and i raise my son, best i can, better than some
i just found out the other day i got another little one thats on the way
i took a new job down at the factory.yeah it dont pay much but at least we can eat
i roll up a smoke and make a new plan, these are the struggles of a workin man

Dm                                  C      G                                    Dm
went down to the river just the other day, got down on my knees and began to pray
          Dm                     C                                   Dm
