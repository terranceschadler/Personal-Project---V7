[Chorus]
         A
Don't worry, about a thing

Smile with the rising sun
             A                 D
Three little birds perch by my doorstep
        A
Singin' sweet songs
            E
Of melodies pure and true
        D                      A
Singin', this is my message to you-ou-ou

              A
Singin' don't worry, about a thing
       D                                   A
Cause' every little thing, (is) gonna be alright
               A
Singin' don't worry, (don't worry) about a thing
       D                              A
Cause' every little thing, gonna be alright

Three little birds perch by my doorstep
        A
Singin' sweet songs
            E
Of melodies pure and true
        D                      A
Singing, this is my message to you-ou-ou
