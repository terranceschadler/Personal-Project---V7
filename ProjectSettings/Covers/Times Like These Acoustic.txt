On the parts for Am and Em use the sevens

to the song. i think Dave Grohl uses the sevens.

Listen to song for timing and strumming

(intro) D13

D                Am
I, I’m a one way motorway 
                 C            Em                D13
I’m the one that drives away, follows you back home
D                    Am
I, I’m a streetlight shining
                  C                Em              D13
I’m a white light blinding bright, burning off and on


(chorus)
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you give and give again
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em             D13
It’s times like these time and time again


D                Am
I, I’m a new day rising
                C        Em                D13
I’m a brand new sky that hangs stars upon tonight
D                 Am
I, I’m a little divided
             C            Em            D13
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind


(chorus)
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you give and give again
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em             D
It’s times like these time and time again


(oh, oh, oh part)
C...Em...D...C...Em...D
C...Em...D...C...Em...D
C...Em...D...D13


(chorus)
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you learn to live again
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you give and give again
     C                    Em            D
It’s times like these you learn to love again
     C                Em             D     C
It’s times like these time and time again
