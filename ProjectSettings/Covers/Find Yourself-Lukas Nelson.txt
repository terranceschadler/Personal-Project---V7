Well I don't mind sleeping alone
                                            Bbm
If it means I don't have to play your crazy games no more

But I ain't gonna let it slide when you're mean to me

   I know the love that I deserve

[Chorus]
      Ab
And I hope you find yourself
                       Bbm
Before I find somebody else to be my love
  Ab
I hope you find yourself
                       Bbm

Well, you tell me things I wanna hear
                                         Bbm
You want me near, and I know you feel me leaving you
