Like a Stone (acoustic)Chris Cornell


[Intro]

Am  G  Em7  F
Am  G  Em7  F


[Verse]

     Am       G
On a cobweb afternoon
     Em7          F
In a room full of emptiness
     Am      G
By a freeway I confess
   Em7            F
I was lost in the pages
Am        G
Of a book full of death
Em7               F
Reading how we'll die alone
Am                G
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Em7        F
Anywhere we want to go


[Chorus]

Am        C      G        Am
  In your house I long to be
Am      C    G     Am
Room by room patiently
F                Am
I'll wait for you there
G      Am        F             Am
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
E
Alone


[Instrumental]

Am  G  Em7  F


[Verse]

      Am       G
On my deathbed I will pray
   Em7              F
To the gods and the angels
       Am       G
Like a pagan to anyone
    Em7             F
Who will take me to heaven
Am         G
To a place I recall
Em7            F
I was there so long ago
    Am
The sky was bruised
    G
The wine was bled
    Em7              F
And there you led me on


[Chorus]

Am        C      G        Am
  In your house I long to be
Am      C    G     Am
Room by room patiently
F                Am
I'll wait for you there
G      Am        F             Am
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
E
Alone


[Bridge]

   F     C
And on I read
   E              F
Until the day was gone
      Fm      D
And I sat in regret
   E               Am
Of all the things I've done
    F             C
For all that I've blessed
    E             F
And all that I've wronged
   Fm              D
In dreams until my death
       E
I will wonder on


[Chorus]

Am        C      G        Am
  In your house I long to be
Am      C    G     Am
Room by room patiently
F                Am
I'll wait for you there
G      Am        F             Am
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
E
Alone
