[Intro]

(Top 4 strings picked slowly down then up)

Em x4


[Verse 1]

Em
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                                 Am
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round
                  Am                                      Em
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                                                           Am
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round


[Bridge]

C                        Em
People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    C                        Em
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
       C                                 B7
And be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth


[Chorus]

Em     Am      Em     Gadd9/E Em
Billie Jean is not my lover
             Am       Em                 Am  Bmadd11/A
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
                  Am
She says I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son


[Verse 2]

Em
For forty days and for forty nights. The law was on her side.
                                                        Am
But who can stand when she's in demand. Her schemes and plans.
                                     Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
                    Am                             Em
So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)


[Verse 3]

Em
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
                                                     Am
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine
                                     Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round


[Bridge]

C                        Em
People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
         C                      Em
Then she stood right by me. The smell of sweet perfume.
     C                           B7
This happened much too soon. She called me to her room.


[Chorus]

Em     Am      Em     Gadd9/E Em
Billie Jean is not my lover
             Am       Em                 Am  Bmadd11/A
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
                  Am
She says I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
                    Am                             Em
So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)
