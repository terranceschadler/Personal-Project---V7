You're Beautiful

Capo 3rd fret



C G Am F x3

My life is brilliant



C

 My life is brilliant 

G

 My love is pure

Am 

 I saw an angel

F

 Of that I'm sure

    C

She smiled at me on the subway

        G

She was with another man

    Am

But I won't lose no sleep on that

       F

'Cause I've got a plan





F             G

 You're beautiful

C

 You're beautiful

F             G         C

 You're beautiful, it's true

  F        G

I saw your face

     C   G   Am

In a crowded place

      F          G       Am

And I don't know what to do

            F     G       C

'Cause I'll never be with you



C G Am F



         C

Yes, she caught my eye

      G

As we walked on by

          Am

She could see from my face that I was

F

 Fucking high

    C                       G

And I don't think that I'll see her again

    Am                           F

But we shared a moment that will last to the end



F             G

 You're beautiful

C

 You're beautiful

F             G         C

 You're beautiful, it's true

  F        G

I saw your face

     C   G   Am

In a crowded place

      F          G       Am

And I don't know what to do

            F     G       C

'Cause I'll never be with you





Am          Am          Am          D

La-la-la-la La-la-la-la La-la-la-la La-a



F             G

 You're beautiful

C

 You're beautiful

F             G         C

 You're beautiful, it's true

      F          G

There must be an angel

       C        G   Am

With a smile on her face

         F                        G             C   G   Am

When she thought up that I should be with you

         F       G        Am

But it's time to face the truth

        F    G       C

I will never be with you
