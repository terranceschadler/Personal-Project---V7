[Intro]
G
 
[Chorus 1]
G
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
C                                    G
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
C
It takes a lot to change a man
        G     D/F#     Em
Hell, it takes a lot to try
D                         C         G
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
 
[Verse 1]
G
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
C                                G
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
C                                               G          D/F#          Em
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
D                    C             G
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead
 
C                                          G
I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
C                                         G
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
C                                      G        D/F#        Em            D
But If I could take spirits from my past and bring them here you know I would
    C
Know I would
 
[Verse 2]
G
Nobody speaks to God these days
C                           G
Nobody speaks to God these days
C                                       G        D/F#   Em
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
D                  C          G
Nobody speaks to God these days
 
C                                     G
When I was a child they tried to fool me
C                                                   G
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
C
Well, I've seen Hell in Reno
           G      D/F#      Em         D
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
C
Spinning still
 
[Chorus repeat]
G
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
C                                    G
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
C
It takes a lot to change your plans
        G       D/F#    Em
And a train to change your mind
D                           C         G
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
   D                             C         G
Ooh, Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
