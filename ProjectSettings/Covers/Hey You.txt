Hey you, out there in the cold getting lonely getting old can you feel me?
Hey you standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smuiles, can you feel me?

D                                         G    D   C
  Hey you! don't help them to burry the light

Hey you out there on your own sitting naked by the phone, can you touch me?
Hey you with your ear against the wall waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?

Dsus2                                     G     D    C
 Hey you would you help me to carry the stone

Open you heart, I'm coming home


Guitar solo


C            D    G    D  C
  But it was only fantasy

                  D        G   D   C
The wall was too high, as you can see

               D      Dsus4  G   D     C
No matter he tried he could not break free

                   D          Emadd9
and the worms ate into his brain


Interlude

     Emadd9                                                          Bm
Hey you out there on the road always doing what you're told, can ya help me?
Hey you out there beyond the wall breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?

Dsus2                                         G   D  C
   Hey you! don't tell me there's no hope at all

     Bm          Am            Em
Together we stand, devided we fall....
