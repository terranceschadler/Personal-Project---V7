Learning To Fly (acoustic guitar) chords
Pink Floyd *

G  G Em

G
Into the distance, a ribbon of black;
Em                                       D\G
Stretched to the point of no turning back
  G
A flight of fancy on a windswept field;
Em                           D\G
Standing alone my senses reel
  G
A fatal attraction is holding me fast;
Em                                       D\G
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

C                           Am
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies;
F
Tongue-tied and twisted,
        C           D       G
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

G  G Em

G
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings;
Em                                                  D\G
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
G        
No navigator to find my way home;
Em                                D\G
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

  C                      Am
A soul in tension that's learning to fly;
F                      C
Condition grounded but determined to try
C                           Am
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies;
F
Tongue-tied and twisted,
        C           D       G
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

G
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer;
Em                                            D\G
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
G               
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly;
Em                                  D\G
Out of the corner of my watering eye

  G
A dream unthreatened by the morning light;
Em                                                      D\G
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

        C                  Am
There's no sensation to compare with this;
F                      C
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
C                           Am
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies;
F
Tongue-tied and twisted,
        C           D       G
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
