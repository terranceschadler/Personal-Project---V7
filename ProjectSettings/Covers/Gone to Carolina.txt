Gone to Carolina –Shooter Jennings
(Key of D)



D                              Cadd9
Everytime I think I smell that sweet southern rain
   Cadd9         G              F          D
It takes me to a station on the long black train
D                                      Cadd9
I want to hear the wind blow, feel the earth move below me 
Cadd9               G                 F       D
In spite of all the good times, gotta rest my soul


Chorus
    D             Cadd9
I'm gone, yes, I'm gone 
Cadd9       G                       F   D
Gone To Carolina, where I know that I belong 
         D             Cadd9
Yes, I'm gone, yes, I'm gone 
Cadd9       G                    F      D
Gone To Carolina, where I know I have a home 


(For this part,use the same notes as the first part)
Every time I think I see your face in a crowd         
It's like a bell inside of me and it's ringin' out loud 
I been so high for so long, there's nothing tried nor true 
I'm thinking about coming down to lay a little on you
