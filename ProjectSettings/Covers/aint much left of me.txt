Thought that I'd hit bottom but I ain't there yet
Cause you'd be surprised at how low a man can get.
I watched all them dreams slip through my hands
Now I'm getting outta here while I still can baby

Danced with the devil till I'm in debt
Took all I've got and there ain't much left of me yeah 
I been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here but there ain't much left to see now
Woman I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me.... yeah baby
