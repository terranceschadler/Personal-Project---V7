Capo 5

[Intro]

[Verse 1]

             G                     C 
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
          D                     G    D
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
              G                  C
And I can稚 remember stopping in Denver
        D                                          G
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play


[Chorus]

                  G                       C 
And sometimes I知 drunk and sometimes I知 stoned
              D               G
And yes I get tired of being alone
    G                           C
And I miss my son and I miss my wife
        D                              G
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Verse 2]
              G                 C
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
  D                                    G   D
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
                G                    C
I知 sometimes a winner, most times a loser
       D                                                  G
If the crowd gets into it, it値l all feel the same way to me


[Chorus]

                  G                       C 
And sometimes I知 drunk and sometimes I知 stoned
              D               G
And yes I get tired of being alone
    G                                C
And I miss my daughter and I miss my wife
        D                              G
But the devil named music is taking my life


[Solo]
C   G   C   G


[Chorus]
                  G                       C 
And sometimes I知 drunk and sometimes I知 stoned
              D               G
And yes I get tired of being alone
    G                           C
And I miss my son and I miss my wife
        D                              G
But the devil named music is taking my life

                  G                       C 
And sometimes I知 drunk and sometimes I知 stoned
              D               G
And yes I get tired of being alone
    G                                C
And I miss my daughter and I miss my wife
        D                              G
But the devil named music is taking my life
