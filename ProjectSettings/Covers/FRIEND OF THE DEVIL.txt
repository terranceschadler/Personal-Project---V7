FRIEND OF THE DEVIL- Grateful Dead

GCI lit out from Reno I was trailed by twenty hounds
G                                        C
Didn't get to sleep that night till the morning came around

CHORUS:
D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
Am
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
D
If I get home before day light
AmD
I just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills ...CHORUS

Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air ...CHORUS

BRIDGE:
D
       Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
C
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight
D
Second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
AmCDand if he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me
...CHORUS
