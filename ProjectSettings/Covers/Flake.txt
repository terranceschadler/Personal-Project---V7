Intro - Dm F Bb F

Dm                    F      
I know she said it's alright
Bb                           F
But you can make it up next time
Dm                         F
I know she knows it's not right
Bb                     F     
There ain't no use in lying
Dm                   F
Maybe she thinks I know something
Bb                             F
Maybe maybe she thinks its fine
Dm                       F
Maybe she knows something I don't
Bb                   C
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying

Chorus

F                    C
It seems to me that maybe
Dm                      A 
It pretty much always means no
        Bb           C                   F  C
So don't tell me you might just let it go
F                       C                        
And often times we're lazy
Dm                     A                         
It seems to stand in my way
Bb                  C                                           
Cause no one no not no one
                F       C       
Likes to be let down



Dm                   F
I know she loves the sunrise
Bb                         F
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
    Dm                              F
And I know that when she said she's gonna try
Bb                                F
Well it might not work because of other ties and
Dm                          F
I know she usually has some other ties
    Bb                             F
And I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, I wouldn't want to break 'em
Dm                   F
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Bb               C
Until then well, I'm gonna have to lie to you


F                    C
It seems to me that maybe
Dm                    A
It pretty much always means no
   Bb                C                  F  C
So don't tell me you might just let it go
F                     C
And often times we're lazy
Dm                   A
It seems to stand in my way
      Bb            C
Cause no one no not no one
                 F
Likes to be let down

F                    C
It seems to me that maybe
Dm                    A
It pretty much always means no
   Bb                C                  F  C
So don't tell me you might just let it go
 


F                                                 Bb                  
The harder that you try baby, the further you'll fall
           F                     C
Even with all your money in the whole wide world
F
Please please please don't pass me
Bb
Please please please don't pass me
C              Bb                   F
Please please please don't pass me by

F                                                        Bb
Everything you know about me now baby you gonna have to change
           F                       C
You goin to call it by a brand new name
F
Please please please don't drag me
Bb
Please please please don't drag me
C              Bb                   F
Please please please don't drag me down

F                                                      Bb
Just like your tree down by the water baby I shall not move
           F                         C
Even after all your silly things you do-oo
F
Please please please don't drag me
Bb
Please please please don't drag me
C              Bb                   F
Please please please don't drag me down
