ONE HORSE TOWN by Blackberry Smoke

Organ Intro : Dm F C G - Dm F C
Guitar Intro: Am C

(Verse)
          Dm                    F
In the tiny town where I come from
       C                                       G
You grew up doing what your daddy does
                Dm                              F              C
And you don't ask questions you do it just because
                Dm                     F
You don't climb to high or dream too much
            C                                   G
With a whole lot of work and a little bit of luck
              Dm                 F                                   C
You can wind up right back where your daddy was

(Chorus)
                       Am                           F
This little bitty town it ain't nothing new
                    C                                            G            Em
We all stick around 'cause they all tell us too
                      Am                                           C
Swallow your pride just to make your family proud
              G                                                             F
If I didn't think that it would shut the whole place down
    F                            G                               Am
I'd ride my pony right out of this one horse town

(Verse)
Yeah this one horse town
I'm an old married man at the age of 23
Got 2 little boys on the baseball team
And that might be their only ticket out
All they got is a worn out name
And a daddy that could've gone all the way
But I hang my saddle up and I settled down

(SOLO) Dm F C G - Dm F C

(Chorus)
This little bitty town it ain't nothing new
We all stick around 'cause they all tell us too
Swallow your pride just to make your family proud
If I didn't think that it would shut the whole place down
I'd ride my poney right out of this one horse town
Yeah this one horse town
Oh yeah

(Chorus)
This little bitty town oh yeah it ain't nothing new
We all stick around 'cause they all tell us too
Swallow your pride just to keep your family proud
If I didn't think that it would shut the whole thing down
I'd sattle that one horse and ride it right out of this town
