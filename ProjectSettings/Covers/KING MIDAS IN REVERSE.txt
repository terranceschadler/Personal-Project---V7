KING MIDAS IN REVERSE- The Hollies/Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young

GC
If you could only see me
GCCaddFCCaddA
And know exactly who I am
GC
You wouldn't want to be me
B7
Why I can assure you of that
GC
I'm not the guy to run with
GC
Cos I'll throw you off the line
GC
I'll break you and destroy you
B7
Given time

CHORUS:
GFmaj7FaddG
He's King Midas with a curse
CGG/CG
He's King Midas in reverse
GFmaj7FaddG
He's King Midas with a curse
CG
He's King Midas in reverse

It's plain to see it's hopeless
Going on the way we are
So even though I lose you
We'd be better off by far

BRIDGE:
Bm
He's not the man to hold your trust
BmaddBbBm7E
Everything he touches turns to dust in his hands
Bm
Nothing he can do is right
BmaddBbBm7E
He'd even like to sleep at night, but he can't

CHORUS

I wish someone would find me
And help me gain control
Before I lose my reason and my soul
CHORUS
