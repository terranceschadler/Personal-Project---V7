Two six packs of Shiner

D                                G,.- 
Lucky Strikes and a fifth of Patron

Tank of gas that autuh do er'
D                            G,.- 
I can feel a good one comin'on

Throw in Ray Wylie Hubbard
Sing along to "Redneck Mother"
Any blues I had before are gone
Another workin' week is over
No chance of stayin' sober
I can feel a good one comin' on

[Chorus]
                C    G,.-   D
Yea we're gonna roll all night
            C       G,.-       D
We're gonna get the feelin' right
            C         G,.-     D                Em       C
We're gonna keep this party rockin' till the break of dawn
C            D               G,.-
I can feel a good one comin' on

[Verse 2]
Three blondes in a rag top Mustang
Followed us down to the lake and...
Didn't have to think about that too long
Skinny dippin' in the bright moonlight
Situation couldn't be more right
I can feel a good one comin' on

[Chorus]
                C    G,.-   D
Yea we're gonna roll all night
            C       G,.-       D
We're gonna get the feelin' right
            C         G,.-     D                Em       C
We're gonna keep this party rockin' till the break of dawn
C            D               G,.-
I can feel a good one comin' on
