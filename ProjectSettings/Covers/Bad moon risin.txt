Well d	on't go round tonite, it's 	bound to take your life
 	A	G	D
Th	ere's a 	bad moon on the 	rise
I hear hurricanes a blowin'
I know the end is coming soon
I feel rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage & ruin
Well don't go round tonite, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite well prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is takin' for an eye
Don't go round tonite, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't go round tonite, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
