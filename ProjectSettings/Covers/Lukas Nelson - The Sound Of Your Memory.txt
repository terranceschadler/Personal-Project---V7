Lukas Nelson - The Sound Of Your Memory

 G                     C          G       
It's four AM ain't no sleep to be found
     G                            F   
Your face is in my mind spinnin round
                                         G    
Awake I will dream in my dream you'll be there
  G                   C      G      
I can't get away from you anywhere

Ever since I met you my lifes been a song
A sad song a love song with hate in between
You'd be breaking my heart it was clear from the start
But my pin and my paper will keep my mind clean

C                            G    
I can't breathe when you're around
    G                                  F
My heart doesn't beat my mouth doesn't speak
                                   G
And I can't sleep becasuse of the sound
     G                          C           G
The sound of your memory that's bringing me down
     G                          C           G  
The sound of your memory that's bringing me down


I can't see myself without seeing you
I can't touch anything that don't feel like you do
Every place that I go I'll be looking for you
And it hurts me to know that you don't love me too
