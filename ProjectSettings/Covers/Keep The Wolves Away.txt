[Intro]

Bm  D  A  G

[Verse 1]
Bm
Took my first breath where the muddy Brazos
D
spills into the gulf of Mexico
          A
where the skylines covered my chemical plants
         G
that put bread on the table of a workin man
         Bm
well the workin man does his best to provide
D
safety and shelter for kids and a wife
A
given a little of his soul everyday
      G (strum once and let ring)
makin overtime to keep the wolves away

[Verse 2]

Bm
Well I was barely thirteen when the company man
D
Tried to dig my daddy's grave
 A
It happened on a French owned tanker ship
 G
Spillin' poison into Galveston Bay
Bm
The liquid fire filled his lungs and his eyes
D
Silenced, any moans or cries   
 A
Cold and the Grit, the damn stinkin pain
      G (strum once and let ring)
but he fought like hell to keep the wolves away.

*insrtumental chorus same as before

For the next few years dad was sick as a dog
but he made a recovery just to spite the odds.
Settlement came and we moved out of town
where the sky isn't heavy with refinery clouds.
Yeah he's still alive he's doing good he's in his fifties
but the money's runnin out and he's pinchin pennies
so I'm going for broke with every song I play,
cause now it's my turn to keep the wolves away.
