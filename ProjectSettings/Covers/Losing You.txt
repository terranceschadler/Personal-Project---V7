        G                                    C 
There's no such thing as sleep for a jealous fool
         C               G               A7              D  
And bein jealous iof someone like you is sort of foolish too
     G                                        C
The life you've chose is the life you want, I guess
       G         D                 G    G7 
Losing you might be the best thing yet


Chorus:
    C                                   G
The longest day I'll live I'll still be sufferin from the shame
        G                      A7               D
And the gutter you were making yourself quite a name
  G                                          C
I wanted you and you wanted anyone you could get
       G         D                 G
Losing you might be the best thing yet


Fiddle solo


Patiently I sit alone and wait
Knowing where you were and what you were doing turned my love to hate 
My foolishness is all that I regret
Losing you might be the best thing yet

Chorus


Losing you might be the best thing yet
