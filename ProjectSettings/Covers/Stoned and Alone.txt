Stoned and Alone
E
well why does it hurt when i see you again
B7                              A
is it the memory, or jack daniels on your skin
E
and i dont know if i'm out of control
B7                             A
cause lately i been spinning and drinking alone
E
will you pick up the gun dear and put me asleep
B7                                    A             
sleeping on misery and shes cutting me real deep

A                 E   B7  A
and i'm all alone, 
A                   E  B7   A
drifting and stoned, 
A                E   B7  A
being too far gone
A                        E  B7  A
well i'm stoned and alone

hell i been surrounded by w***es and thieves
that was always trying to get the best of me
and i dont mind getting thrown out on the street
cause i can get by without much to eat

will you pick up the gun dear and put me asleep
cause i'm sleeping on misery and shes cutting me real deep
and i'm all alone.....

i'm drifting and stoned...
being too far gone...
well i'm stoned and alone...
