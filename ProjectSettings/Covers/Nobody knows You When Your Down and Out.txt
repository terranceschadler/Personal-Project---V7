Nobody knows You When Your Down and Out





G               B7         E            E7
Once I lived the life of a millionaire,

Am       E7                    Am
Spending money, didn't have any care,

C                          G             E7
I took my friends out for a mighty good time,

A7                     D7
Bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine.




G       B7      E          E7
Then I began to fall so low,

  Am           E7                    Am
I didn't have a friend, and no place to go

C                      G       E7
If I get my hands on a dollar again,

A7                                D7
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagles grin.




G  B7     E      E7
Nobody knows you

Am          E7         Am
When you're down and out,

C              G         E7
In your pocket not one penny,

A7                  D7
And as for friends, you haven't any;

   G             B7            E        E7
But when you get back on your feet again,

Am         E7                Am
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend,

C                    G            E7
It's mighty strange, without any doubt,

A7                           D7
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.

A7
Nobody knows you,

C                                                                          
Nobody knows you,

A7          D7                        G7
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.
