w/Main Riff:

Am     C (½)    Dsus2 (½)   Am       C (½)   Dsus2 (½)     

      I hurt myself today          to see if     I still feel

Am    C (½)    Dsus2 (½)     Am         C (½)  Dsus2 (½)     

      I focus    on the pain         the only thing that's real

Am         C (½)    Dsus2 (½)   Am         C (½)   Dsus2 (½)     

      The needle tears a hole         the old familiar sting

Am            C (½)   Dsus2 (½)  Am            C (½)       Dsus2 (½)           

      Try to kill it all away            but I remember everything

 

Chorus:

G   Am7                      Fadd9  C                        G

    What have I become?             My sweetest friend

Am7              Fadd9        C             G

Everyone I know   goes away in the end

       Am7                   Fadd9   G (2)

And you could have it all        My empire of dirt

Am7              Fadd9        G

I will let you down            I will make you hurt

w/Main Riff:

Am     C (½)      Dsus2 (½)   Am    C (½)   Dsus2 (½)     

    I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair

Am    C (½)    Dsus2 (½)    Am        C (½)   Dsus2 (½)     

       Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair

Am      C (½)         Dsus2 (½) Am          C (½)     Dsus2 (½)     

    Beneath the stains of time       the feelings disappear

Am     C (½)     Dsus2 (½)   Am   C (½)  Dsus2 (½)     

         You are someone else       I am still right here

 

Chorus 2:

G   Am7              Fadd9    C                       G

    What have I become?       My sweetest friend

Am7              Fadd9                 C             G

Everyone I know           goes away in the end

       Am7              Fadd9  G (2)

And you could have it all   My empire of dirt

Am7              Fadd9        G (2)

I will let you down            I will make you hurt

 

Am7                  Fadd9         G (2)

If I could start again         A million miles away

Am7              Fadd9      G (hold)

I would keep myself        I would find a way
