Don't lose your mind
Don't let your thoughts control you
I tell myself this all the time
'Cause you're not real

Don't lose control
I speak it like a mantra
Like lightning before thunder
You're not real
You're not real

And when the world comes crashing down
My heart becomes my savior
I'm hiding in it's arms
'Cause you're not real

Don't lose your soul
Don't waste your time with people
I don't care who looks at me
Or what they say
'Cause they're not real
They're not real

Work hard for life
Don't act like you deserve it
Though you know it to be true
The world you know
Can end on you
Don't lose your mind
Don't lose your mind
Don't lose your mind
Don't lose your mind
