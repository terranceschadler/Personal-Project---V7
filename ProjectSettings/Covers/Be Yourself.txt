Be Yourself - Chris Cornell


Chris often plays the Bm and Bmsus2 chords with an F# in the bass. He also varies how he plays the Em7 chord,
from simply lifting off of the 6 string when moving from G to Em7, to putting his second finger on the second
fret of the D string. During the Bridge, listen for when Chris lifts off of the 2nd string when playing Bm
to turn it into Bmsus2. During the first part of the Outro he picks the strings individually on the Bm a bit.

[Verse 1]

Bm                    D             G           Em7                   
    Someone falls to pieces sleeping all alone, someone kills the pain
Bm                    D          G            Em7
    Spinning in the silence, she finally drifts away
Bm                  D           G           Em7
    Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Bm            D           G           Em7       Em7
    Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave


[Chorus]

   Bm                   D             G           Em7  
And To be yourself is all that you can do      Heyyy-eeeey
   Bm            D                 G         Em7
To be yourself is all that you can doooooooooooooooooooooo

[Verse 2]

Bm                   D            G       Em7
    Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Bm                  D                   G                Em7
    Someone tries to hide himself down inside himself he prays
Bm                       D                 G          Em7
    Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Bm             D        G            Em7      Em7
    Separate or united, healthy or insaaaaaaaane


[Chorus]

   Bm                   D             G           Em7

And To be yourself is all that you can do      Heyyy-eeeey
   Bm            D                 G         Em7
To be yourself is all that you can doooooooooooooooooooooo

G                    A
    Even when you've paid enough
      Bm           Bmsus2     
Been put upon or been held up
G                    A
    with every single memory of
     Bm            Bmsus2
The good or bad, faces of luck
 G                   A
    don't lose any sleep tonight
         Bm               Bmsus2
I'm sure everything will end up alright
G                 A        A        A        A
   You may win or looooooooooooooooooooooooooose

   Bm                   D         G               Em7  
To be yourself is all that you can, be yourself is all that you can
   Bm                   D         G               Em7
