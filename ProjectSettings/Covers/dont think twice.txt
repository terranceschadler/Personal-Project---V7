Intro G  Em C D

         G                             Em
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why
C                  D
  if you don't know by now
       G                             Em
and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why
C                     D
  it doesn't matter anyhow


         G
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
C                       D
Look out your window and I'll be gone
G                            Em
  You're the reason that I'm travellin' on
C            D             G
Don't think twice, it's all right


And it ain't no use in turnin' on you light
A light I never knowed
and it ain't no use in turnin' on your light
I'm on the dark side of the road


I wish there were something you would do or say
To make me wanna change my mind and stay
We never did much talkin' anyway
but don't think twice, it's all right


And it ain't no use in callin' out my name
like you never done before
and it ain't no use in callin' out my name
I can't hear you anymore


I'm thinkin' and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I'd give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right


(Solo)


I'm goin' down that long lonesome road
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word
So I'll just say, fare thee well


I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
I could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
but don't think twice, it's all right

      C            D             G
Yeah, don't think twice, it's all right
       C           D
Yeah, don't think twice,
          C           D
don't you ever think twice
       C           D              G      C   G  D   G
Yeah, don't think twice, it's all right
