Verse #1:
How do you feel, that is the question 
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer 
When something like a soul becomes initialized 
Folded up like paper dolls and little notes 
You can't expect a bit of hope 
And while you're outside looking in 
Describing what you see 
Remember what you're staring at is me 

Chorus #2:
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass 
Don't know how much time has passed 
All I know is that it feels like forever 
When no one ever tells you that forever 
Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head 

Verse #2:
How much is real, so much to question 
An Epidemic of the mannequins 
Contaminating everything 
When thought came from the heart 
It never did right from the start 
Just listen to the noises 
(No more sad voices) 
Before you tell yourself 
It's just a different scene 
Remembering is just different from what you've seen

 Stone Sour Through Glass Lyrics
Through Glass

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head


How do you feel, that is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

How much is real, so much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart,
But never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
null and void instead of voices
Before you tell yourself
It's just a different scene
Remember its just different from what you've seen

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
sitting all alone inside your head

cause i'm looking at you through the glass, don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head...

And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you yeh ya

And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you yeh ya


I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
sitting all alone inside your head

And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you yeh ya
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you yeh ya
And it's the stars
The stars that shine for you yeh ya
And it's the stars
The stars that lie to you yeh ya

Who are the stars?
Who are the stars?
They lie…
